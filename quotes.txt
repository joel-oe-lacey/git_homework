"My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.‚Äù - PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY

"There wasn't any limit,
no boundary at all, to the future.
And it would be so a man wouldn't
have room to store his happiness." - John Steinbeck, East of Eden
